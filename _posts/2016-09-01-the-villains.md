![Rock'n roll thieves - available for hire](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9aa80cef-c11e-4b1f-ab63-79ab227bcb92.jpg)

stealing the best rock n roll indie, classic rock and blues and making them our own, the Villains are a four piece covers band that will put the beefy into your evening. 

With over four hours of highly charged rock'n roll there'ssomething for every type of event - whether that's more classic tunes from Chick Berry, The Beatles, Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, or, the more recent rock' Neill from the the likes of Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, Royal Blood.

Or perhaps you prefer Kings of Leon, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, Primal Scream and The Strokes.

Whatever you need, we've stolen it! 

We also add a little extra twist by mashing up some of the tunes and even rocking up some unexpected songs which we picked up during our heists.
